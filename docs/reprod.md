## Bug Reproduction

**Before reproducing the bugs, please ensure your local environment meets all the [requirements](https://github.com/sieve-project/sieve#requirements) otherwise Sieve may not work.**

### Time travel
First, build the operators:
```
python3 build.py -p kubernetes -m time-travel -d DOCKER_REPO_NAME
python3 build.py -p cassandra-operator -m time-travel -d DOCKER_REPO_NAME
python3 build.py -p zookeeper-operator -m time-travel -d DOCKER_REPO_NAME
python3 build.py -p rabbitmq-operator -m time-travel -d DOCKER_REPO_NAME
python3 build.py -p mongodb-operator -m time-travel -d DOCKER_REPO_NAME
python3 build.py -p xtradb-operator -m time-travel -d DOCKER_REPO_NAME
python3 build.py -p cass-operator -m time-travel -d DOCKER_REPO_NAME
python3 build.py -p casskop-operator -m time-travel -d DOCKER_REPO_NAME
```
Please specify the `DOCKER_REPO_NAME` that you have write access to as sieve needs to push controller image to the repo.

The above commands will download, instrument and build Kubernetes and controller images used for testing.
For Kubernetes, we use the branch `v1.18.9`.
For each controller, we use a default commit SHA specified in `controllers.py`. You can also specify which commit of the operator you want to test by `-s COMMIT_SHA`, but the bugs may not be reproduced with other commits as some of them have been fixed after our reports.

### Observability gaps
First, build the operators:
```
python3 build.py -p kubernetes -m obs-gap -d DOCKER_REPO_NAME
python3 build.py -p cassandra-operator -m obs-gap -d DOCKER_REPO_NAME
python3 build.py -p rabbitmq-operator -m obs-gap -d DOCKER_REPO_NAME
python3 build.py -p casskop-operator -m obs-gap -d DOCKER_REPO_NAME
```
Please specify the `DOCKER_REPO_NAME` that you have write access to as sieve needs to push controller image to the repo.

The above commands will download, instrument and build Kubernetes and controller images used for testing.
For Kubernetes, we use the branch `v1.18.9`.
For each controller, we use a default commit SHA specified in `controllers.py`. You can also specify which commit of the operator you want to test by `-s COMMIT_SHA`, but the bugs may not be reproduced with other commits as some of them have been fixed after our reports.
