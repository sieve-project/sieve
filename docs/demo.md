## Using Sieve to detect a time-travel bug in rabbitmq-operator

**Before trying the demo, please ensure your local environment meets all the [requirements](https://github.com/sieve-project/sieve#requirements) otherwise Sieve may not work.**

### What is Sieve?

Sieve is a bug detection tool for finding various bugs, including time-travel bugs, in kubernetes controllers.

### What is a time-travel bug?

Time-travel bugs refer to the bugs caused by a controller "going back in time" after restarts.
Time-travel bugs happen when the controller reads stale cluster state from a *stale* apiserver and behaves unexpectedly. Consider the following scenario:

<img src="time-travel.png" width="80%">

1. In a HA kubernetes cluster, the controller is connected to apiserver1. Initially each apiserver is updated with the current cluster state `S1`, and the controller performs reconciliation according to the state read from apiserver1.

2. Now apiserver1's locally cached state gets updated by etcd to `S2`, while apiserver2's does not get updated in time and still holds the stale state `S1` (due to various reasons like apiserver2 being slow, experiencing a network disruption or temporary resource contention).

3. The controller restarts after experiencing a node failure and connects to apiserver2. The controller reads stale `S1` and performs reconciliation accordingly. The reconciliation triggered by reading `S1` again may lead to some unexpected behavior and cause failures like data loss or service unavailability.


We will use [a time-travel bug](https://github.com/rabbitmq/cluster-operator/issues/648) in [rabbitmq-operator](https://github.com/rabbitmq/cluster-operator) found by Sieve to show the end-to-end experience of testing the controller using Sieve.
In general, Sieve performs failure testing by pausing the apiserver and restarting the controller at certain timing to make the controller experience time travel.

### Prerequisite
**Kind cluster is required**. Sieve tests the controller in a kind cluster.

**The controller needs to be recompiled**. Sieve needs to instrument the `controller_runtime` and `client_go` libraries and rebuild the controller image. The instrumentation is automatically done.

**Test workloads are required.** Sieve doesn't generate test workloads to run. Sieve can reuse any existing e2e test workload that doesn't perform cluster set up (Sieve will set up the cluster for testing). We also wrote some simple workloads for Sieve.

### Testing the controller using Sieve
Now, let's test the rabbitmq-operator.

First build Kubernetes kind image and the controller image:
```
python3 build.py -p kubernetes -m time-travel
python3 build.py -p rabbitmq-operator -m time-travel -s 4f13b9a942ad34fece0171d2174aa0264b10e947
```
The above commands download Kubernetes and controller source code, instrument the source code and build the images.
For Kubernetes, we use the branch `v1.18.9`. For the controller, we use `-s` to specify the commit id. 

Then run the test
```
python3 sieve.py -p rabbitmq-operator -t recreate -c test-rabbitmq-operator/test/time-travel-1.yaml
```
`-p rabbitmq-operator` specifies the operator that Sieve will test. We have already done some porting effort before testing rabbitmq-operator so Sieve can accept this option.

`-t recreate` is the test workload (written by us) that Sieve will run.
The workload simply does three things:
1. it creates a rabbitmq cluster
2. it deletes the rabbitmq cluster
3. it recreates the rabbitmq cluster

`-c test-rabbitmq-operator/test/time-travel-1.yaml` is a configuration file that guides the failure testing. Triggering a time-travel bug requires lagging apiservers/restarting controllers with particular timing. The time-travel configuration file encodes the particular timing so no manual intervention is required during testing.

By typing the above command, Sieve will:
1. run the `recreate` workload against the kind kubernetes cluster;
2. create the time-travel scenario during the test run according to the configuration file, `test-rabbitmq-operator/test/time-travel-1.yaml`.

When it finishes, you will see the bug report generated by Sieve:
```
[BUG REPORT]
Checking for controller side effects (resource creation/deletion)...
[ERROR] statefulset/default/rabbitmq-cluster-server CREATE inconsistency: 2 events seen during learning run, but 3 seen during testing run
[ERROR] statefulset/default/rabbitmq-cluster-server DELETE inconsistency: 1 events seen during learning run, but 2 seen during testing run
[TIME TRAVEL DESCRIPTION] Sieve makes the controller time travel back to the history to see the status just after rabbitmqcluster/default/rabbitmq-cluster: {"metadata": {"deletionTimestamp": "SIEVE-NON-NIL", "deletionGracePeriodSeconds": 0}} (at kind-control-plane3)
[DEBUGGING SUGGESTION] Please check how controller reacts when seeing rabbitmqcluster/default/rabbitmq-cluster: {"metadata": {"deletionTimestamp": "SIEVE-NON-NIL", "deletionGracePeriodSeconds": 0}}, the controller may issue deletion to statefulset/default/rabbitmq-cluster-server without proper checking
```
Sieve generates a bug report saying that the controller issues more `CREATE` and `DELETE` operations for the resource named `statefulset/default/rabbitmq-cluster-server` than normal. It suggests that this inconsistency is probably caused by the controller issuing deletions without proper checking when seeing the non-nil `deletionTimestamp` of the resource named `rabbitmqcluster/default/rabbitmq-cluster`.

### Debugging with Sieve report
Sieve gives us a hint about the bug, but cannot automatically tell us the root cause. Debugging still requires some manual effort. Here is my experience:

I searched for `deletionTimestamp` in the controller code to see how the controller reacts to it and I found:
```go
	// Check if the resource has been marked for deletion
	if !rabbitmqCluster.ObjectMeta.DeletionTimestamp.IsZero() {
		logger.Info("Deleting")
		return ctrl.Result{}, r.prepareForDeletion(ctx, rabbitmqCluster)
	}
```
The controller immediately deletes the statefulset when seeing non-nil `deletionTimestamp` without checking the ownership of the statefulset in `prepareForDeletion`.

Combining the `TIME TRAVEL DESCRIPTION` and the `DEBUGGING SUGGESTION` from Sieve, the bug is identified:
After the rabbitmq cluster gets recreated, Sieve makes the controller time travel back to see the non-nil `deletionTimestamp` (caused by the previous rabbitmq cluster deletion). Since the controller does not check statefuset ownership in `prepareForDeletion`, it immediately deletes the currently running statefulset as a reaction of seeing the stale `deletionTimestamp`.

The detected bug is filed at https://github.com/rabbitmq/cluster-operator/issues/648 and has been fixed.

### How does Sieve find bugs?
To detect time-travel bugs, Sieve runs in two phases to force the controller to experience time travel by injecting apiserver pause and controller restart.

The first phase is called *learning phase* where Sieve runs the test workload (without any injection) and records the events triggering controller reconciliation and side effects (resource creation/deletion/update) invoked by the controller. Sieve analyzes the controller trace and generates the time-travel config to guide the following testing phase. Sieve also records the cluster status and controller behavior as part of the testing oracle.

The second phase is called *testing phase* where Sieve runs the test workload and injects apiserver pause and controller restart at certain timing according to the time-travel config. Sieve compares the cluster status and controller behavior in the testing run and the learning run, and generates a bug report if any inconsistency is detected.


### What is in the time-travel config?

Recall that we need to pause the apiserver and restart the controller with **a certain timing**. The time travel configuration file specifies the required timing for pausing the apiservers or restarting the controller.

Let's look into the generated time-travel config `test-rabbitmq-operator/test/time-travel-1.yaml`:
```
project: rabbitmq-operator
mode: time-travel
straggler: kind-control-plane3
front-runner: kind-control-plane
operator-pod-label: rabbitmq-operator
deployment-name: rabbitmq-operator
timing: after
ce-name: rabbitmq-cluster
ce-namespace: default
ce-rtype: rabbitmqcluster
ce-diff-current: '{"metadata": {"deletionTimestamp": "SIEVE-NON-NIL", "deletionGracePeriodSeconds": 0}}'
ce-diff-previous: '{}'
ce-etype-current: Updated
ce-etype-previous: Updated
se-name: rabbitmq-cluster-server
se-namespace: default
se-rtype: statefulset
se-etype: ADDED
description: 'Pause kind-control-plane3 after it processes a default/rabbitmqcluster/rabbitmq-cluster
  event E. E should match the pattern {"metadata": {"deletionTimestamp": "SIEVE-NON-NIL",
  "deletionGracePeriodSeconds": 0}} and the events before E should match {}. And restart
  the controller rabbitmq-operator after kind-control-plane processes a ADDED default/statefulset/rabbitmq-cluster-server
  event.'
```
It looks quite complicated. But don't worry. For now, you only need to understand a few fields here.

First,
```
straggler: kind-control-plane3
front-runner: kind-control-plane
```
means during testing we want to pause apiserver3 (which runs on `kind-control-plane3`) at *certain timing* to create the stale status.
And we use apiserver1 (which runs on `kind-control-plane`) as a reference to restart the controller at *certain timing*.
The difficult part is how to decide the *timing* here.

Now let's look at
```
ce-name: rabbitmq-cluster
ce-namespace: default
ce-rtype: rabbitmqcluster
ce-diff-current: '{"metadata": {"deletionTimestamp": "SIEVE-NON-NIL", "deletionGracePeriodSeconds": 0}}'
ce-diff-previous: '{}'
```
This is how Sieve decides when to pause the apiserver3. When Sieve sees an event belonging to `rabbitmqcluster/default/rabbitmq-cluster` and contains the sub-map in `ce-diff-current`, and a previous event contains the sub-map in `ce-diff-previous`,
Sieve will pause the apiserver3. Here, `ce-diff-current` basically means the event sets a `deletionTimestamp`, and `ce-diff-previous` does not pose any constraint since it is empty.

Finally, Sieve needs to decide when to restart the controller
```
se-name: rabbitmq-cluster-server
se-namespace: default
se-rtype: statefulset
se-etype: ADDED
```
When Sieve sees an `ADDED` event belonging to `statefulset/default/rabbitmq-cluster-server`, it will restart the controller and connect the controller to the paused apiserver3.

You will also find the explanation from the `description` field.


### How is the time-travel config generated?
The biggest challenge to generate the above time-travel config is to find out the appropriate timing for injecting pause/restart.

As mentioned above, Sieve has a learning phase to infer the causality between events triggering `reconcile()` and side effects (resource creation/update/deletion) issued during `reconcile()`,
and Sieve then picks each potentially causal-related <event, side effect> pair to decide the timing. 

To do so, run:
```
python3 sieve.py -p rabbitmq-operator -t recreate -s learn
```
The command will run the test workload `recreate`, collect the events and side effects, infer the causality and generate the time-travel config.

After it finishes, you will see
```
Generated 1 time-travel config(s) in log/rabbitmq-operator/recreate-rabbitmq-cluster/learn/generated-config
```

The generated config is exactly the same as used in test.
