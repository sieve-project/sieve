## Using Sonar to detect a time-travel bug in rabbitmq-operator

### What is Sonar?

Sonar is a bug detection tool for finding various bugs, including time-travel bugs, in kubernetes controllers.
Time-travel bugs refer to the bugs caused by a controller "going back in time" after restarts.

### What is a time-travel bug?

Time-travel bugs happen when the controller reads stale cluster state from a *stale* apiserver and behaves unexpectedly. Consider the following scenario:

<img src="time-travel.png" width="80%">

1. In a HA kubernetes cluster, the controller is connected to apiserver1. Initially each apiserver is updated with the current cluster state `S1`, and the controller performs reconciliation according to the state read from apiserver1.

2. Now apiserver2's locally cached status gets updated by etcd to `S2`, while apiserver2's does not get updated in time and still holds the stale state `S1` (due to various reasons like apiserver2 being slow, experiencing a network disruption or temporary resource contention).

3. The controller restarts after experiencing a node failure and connects to apiserver2. The controller reads stale `S1` and performs reconciliation accordingly. The reconciliation triggered by reading `S1` again may lead to some unexpected behavior and cause failures like data loss or service unavailability.


We will use [a time-travel bug](https://github.com/rabbitmq/cluster-operator/issues/648) in [rabbitmq-operator](https://github.com/rabbitmq/cluster-operator) found by Sonar to show the end-to-end experience of testing the controller using Sonar.
In general, Sonar performs failure testing by pausing the apiserver and restarting the controller at certain timing to make the controller experience time travel.

### Prerequisite
**Kind cluster is required**. Sonar tests the controller in a kind cluster.

**The controller needs to be recompiled**. Sonar needs to instrument the `controller_runtime` and `client_go` libraries and rebuild the controller image. The instrumentation is automatically done.

**Test workloads are required.** Sonar doesn't generate test workloads to run. Sonar can reuse any existing e2e test workload that doesn't perform cluster set up (Sonar will set up the cluster for testing). We also wrote some simple workloads for Sonar.

### Testing the controller with time travel config
Now, let's test the rabbitmq-operator
```
python3 sonar.py -p rabbitmq-operator -t recreate-rabbitmq-cluster -c log/rabbitmq-operator/recreate-rabbitmq-cluster/learn/generated-config/time-travel-config-1.yaml
```
`recreate-rabbitmq-cluster` is the test workload (written by us) that Sonar will run.
The workload simply does three things:
1. it creates a rabbitmq cluster `kubectl apply -f rmqc-1.yaml`
2. it deletes the rabbitmq cluster `kubectl delete RabbitmqCluster rabbitmq-cluster`
3. it recreates the rabbitmq cluster `kubectl apply -f rmqc-1.yaml`

`log/rabbitmq-operator/recreate-rabbitmq-cluster/learn/generated-config/time-travel-config-1.yaml` is a configuration file which guides the failure testing (for example, the schedule for restarting controllers or lagging apiservers). We will later explain how this configuration file is generated.

By typing the above command, Sonar will:
1. run the `recreate-rabbitmq-cluster` workload against the kind kubernetes cluster;
2. create the time-travel scenario during the test run according to the configuration file, `time-travel-config-1.yaml`.

When it finishes, you will see the bug report generated by Sonar:
```
Checking for controller side effects (resource creation/deletion)...
[ERROR] statefulset/default/rabbitmq-cluster-server CREATE inconsistency: 2 events seen during normal run, but 3 seen during testing run
[ERROR] statefulset/default/rabbitmq-cluster-server DELETE inconsistency: 1 events seen during normal run, but 2 seen during testing run
[TIME TRAVEL DESCRIPTION] Sonar makes the controller time travel back to the history to see the status just after rabbitmqcluster/default/rabbitmq-cluster: {"metadata": {"deletionTimestamp": "SONAR-NON-NIL", "deletionGracePeriodSeconds": 0}} (at kind-control-plane3)
[DEBUGGING SUGGESTION] Please check how controller reacts when seeing rabbitmqcluster/default/rabbitmq-cluster: {"metadata": {"deletionTimestamp": "SONAR-NON-NIL", "deletionGracePeriodSeconds": 0}}, the controller may issue deletion to statefulset/default/rabbitmq-cluster-server without proper checking
```
Sonar generates a bug report saying that the controller issues more `CREATE` and `DELETE` operations for the resource named `statefulset/default/rabbitmq-cluster-server` than normal. It suggests that this inconsistency is probably caused by the controller issuing deletions without proper checking when seeing the non-nil `deletionTimestamp` of the resource named `rabbitmqcluster/default/rabbitmq-cluster`.

### Debugging with Sonar report
Sonar gives us a hint about the bug, but cannot automatically tell us the root cause. Debugging still requires some manual effort. Here is my experience:

I searched for `deletionTimestamp` in the controller code to see how the controller reacts to it and I found:
```go
	// Check if the resource has been marked for deletion
	if !rabbitmqCluster.ObjectMeta.DeletionTimestamp.IsZero() {
		logger.Info("Deleting")
		return ctrl.Result{}, r.prepareForDeletion(ctx, rabbitmqCluster)
	}
```
The controller immediately deletes the statefulset when seeing non-nil `deletionTimestamp` without checking the ownership of the statefulset in `prepareForDeletion`.

Combining the `TIME TRAVEL DESCRIPTION` and the `DEBUGGING SUGGESTION` from Sonar, the bug is identified:
After the rabbitmq cluster gets recreated, Sonar makes the controller time travel back to see the non-nil `deletionTimestamp` (caused by the previous rabbitmq cluster deletion). Since the controller does not check statefuset ownership in `prepareForDeletion`, it immediately deletes the currently running statefulset as a reaction of seeing the stale `deletionTimestamp`.

The detected bug is filed at https://github.com/rabbitmq/cluster-operator/issues/648 and has been fixed.

### How does Sonar find bugs?
To detect time-travel bugs, Sonar runs in two phases to force the controller to experience time travel by injecting apiserver pause and controller restart.

The first phase is called *learning phase* where Sonar runs the test workload (without any injection) and records the events triggering controller reconciliation and side effects (resource creation/deletion/update) invoked by the controller. Sonar analyzes the controller trace and generates the time-travel config to guide the following testing phase. Sonar also records the cluster status and controller behavior as part of the testing oracle.

The second phase is called *testing phase* where Sonar runs the test workload and injects apiserver pause and controller restart at certain timing according to the time-travel config. Sonar compares the cluster status and controller behavior in the testing run and the learning run, and generates a bug report if any inconsistency is detected.


### What is in the time-travel config?

Recall that we need to pause the apiserver and restart the controller with **a certain timing**. The time travel configuration file specifies the required timing for pausing the apiservers or restarting the controller.

Let's look into the generated time-travel config `log/rabbitmq-operator/recreate-rabbitmq-cluster/learn/generated-config/time-travel-config-1.yaml`:
```
project: rabbitmq-operator
mode: time-travel
straggler: kind-control-plane3
front-runner: kind-control-plane
operator-pod-label: rabbitmq-operator
deployment-name: rabbitmq-operator
timing: after
ce-name: rabbitmq-cluster
ce-namespace: default
ce-rtype: rabbitmqcluster
ce-diff-current: '{"metadata": {"deletionTimestamp": "SONAR-NON-NIL", "deletionGracePeriodSeconds": 0}}'
ce-diff-previous: '{}'
ce-etype-current: Updated
ce-etype-previous: Updated
se-name: rabbitmq-cluster-server
se-namespace: default
se-rtype: statefulset
se-etype: ADDED
description: 'Pause kind-control-plane3 after it processes a default/rabbitmqcluster/rabbitmq-cluster
  event E. E should match the pattern {"metadata": {"deletionTimestamp": "SONAR-NON-NIL",
  "deletionGracePeriodSeconds": 0}} and the events before E should match {}. And restart
  the controller rabbitmq-operator after kind-control-plane processes a ADDED default/statefulset/rabbitmq-cluster-server
  event.'
```
It looks quite complicated. But don't worry. For now, you only need to understand a few fields here.

First,
```
straggler: kind-control-plane3
front-runner: kind-control-plane
```
means during testing we want to pause apiserver3 (which runs on `kind-control-plane3`) at *certain timing* to create the stale status.
And we use apiserver1 (which runs on `kind-control-plane`) as a reference to restart the controller at *certain timing*.
The difficult part is how to decide the *timing* here.

Now let's look at
```
ce-name: rabbitmq-cluster
ce-namespace: default
ce-rtype: rabbitmqcluster
ce-diff-current: '{"metadata": {"deletionTimestamp": "SONAR-NON-NIL", "deletionGracePeriodSeconds": 0}}'
ce-diff-previous: '{}'
```
This is how Sonar decides when to pause the apiserver3. When Sonar sees an event belonging to `rabbitmqcluster/default/rabbitmq-cluster` and contains the sub-map in `ce-diff-current`, and a previous event contains the sub-map in `ce-diff-previous`,
Sonar will pause the apiserver3. Here, `ce-diff-current` basically means the event sets a `deletionTimestamp`, and `ce-diff-previous` does not pose any constraint since it is empty.

Finally, Sonar needs to decide when to restart the controller
```
se-name: rabbitmq-cluster-server
se-namespace: default
se-rtype: statefulset
se-etype: ADDED
```
When Sonar sees an `ADDED` event belonging to `statefulset/default/rabbitmq-cluster-server`, it will restart the controller and connect the controller to the paused apiserver3.

You will also find the explanation from the `description` field.


### How is the time-travel config generated?
The biggest challenge to generate the above time-travel config is to find out the appropriate timing for injecting pause/restart.

As mentioned above, Sonar has a learning phase to infer the causality between events triggering `reconcile()` and side effects (resource creation/update/deletion) issued during `reconcile()`,
and Sonar then picks each potentially causal-related <event, side effect> pair to decide the timing. 

To do so, run:
```
python3 run.py -p rabbitmq-operator -t recreate-rabbitmq-cluster -m learn
```
The command will run the test workload `recreate-rabbitmq-cluster`, collect the events and side effects, infer the causality and generate the time-travel config.

After it finishes, you will see
```
Generated 1 time-travel config(s) in log/rabbitmq-operator/recreate-rabbitmq-cluster/learn/generated-config
```

The generated config is exactly the one shown before.
