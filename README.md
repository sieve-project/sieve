# Sieve: Testing datacenter infrastructures using partial histories

## Requirements
* Docker daemon must be running (please ensure you can run `docker` commands without sudo)
* A docker repo that you have write access to
* [go1.13.9](https://golang.org/doc/devel/release#go1.13) installed and `$GOPATH` set
* [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) installed and `$KUBECONFIG` set (our kind cluster uses Kubernetes v1.18.9 and etcd)
* python3 installed and `sqlite3`, `kubernetes`ï¼Œ `pyyaml` and `jsondiff` installed
    * `pip3 install kubernetes`
    * `pip3 install pyyaml`
    * `pip3 install pysqlite3`
    * `pip3 install jsondiff`
* [sqlite3](https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360028047592-Installing-a-custom-version-of-SQLite3) (>=3.32) installed

Note: sqlite3 is not required if you want to only reproduce the bugs.

To check for those requirements, you can simply run the following script on the project's root directory,
```shell
python3 check-env.py
```
